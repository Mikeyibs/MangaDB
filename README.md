# MangaDB
Personal project that I plan to work on long term. The goal is to create a website that essentially functions as a one stop shop for information on Japanese manga. I plan to add in user functionality such as the ability to create personal lists and the ability to review manga on the website publicly. 


Notes:
I am treating this project as a learning process. There are going to be times were code pushed to this repo will look basic, messy, or potentially make zero sense. That is because I am still learning a lot of the web technologies I am working on.
Hopefully in the future a project of this size will take me less time and I'll be able to make fun little projects such as this one all the time, while learning new technologies!!
